# Machine_Learning_Course
This repository contains the code for the project of Machine Learning D, course that I have done in AALTO University.


## Project Title

### Project Description
In this project, I developed a model that is able to classify the sentiments of Twitterâ€™s tweet about US airlines. This task is
well known as *sentiment analysis*. It consists determining whether a given text contains _negative_, _positive_, or _neutral_ emotions.
It is widespread that customers tweet about their satisfaction or disappointment after a flight. There can be multiple reasons
behind the emotion such as bad flight, booking problems or customer service issues
